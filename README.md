The output reaches 50% in 411.97ns.

Thus, the difference delay observed when comparing pre-layout simulation with post layout simulation using magic is 1.13ns. And when compared to post layout simulation using ALIGN is 22.72ns.




# Week-1

## Prelayout and Postlayout simulation of a function Fn = [(B+D).(A+C)+E.F]'

I first create schemetic on Xschem and made the necessary connections. A pulse input is provided to each input A, B, C, D, E, F and the output is taken from port Y.

Then the schematic is simulated using ngspice. I obtained the following waveform:

![](week-1/images/Week1-2_preLayoutWaveform.png)

Now, I performed post-layout simulation of the function using Magic. First, the spice file for the function is imported in magic and all the parasitic in the crcuit are extracted which is shown by the screenshot below:

![](week-1/images/Week1-3_layout.png)

New spice file is generated by magic. In the new spice file, I added input pulse and simulate it using ngspice. The following waveform is obtained. 

![](week-1/images/Week1-4_postLayoutSimulation.png)

The waveform is similar to that of pre-layout simulation. However, I observe small delay in the waveform that might be caused due to parasitics in the layout.

Now, I perform post-layout simulation using ALIGN. Here, I first ran ALIGN on the spice file generated by xschem and generated .gds and .lef file. These files can be viewed using klayout. In magic, I read the .gds file. Some DRC(Design Rule Check) errors were observed. I first removed all the DRC errors and extracted spice netlist as shown in the screenshot below.

![](week-1/images/Week1-5_layoutAlign.png)

Then, a new spice file is generated. I again provided the input pulse and simulated the spice file using ngspice. The following waveform is obtained.

### Week-1 Conclusion
In conclusion, the waveform generated while performing pre-layout simulation and post-layout simulation are not exactly the same. In post-layout simulation, parasitic capacitence and resistance are also considered whereas in pre-layout simulation, parasitics are not considered and are connected using ideal wires which is not actually the case in real.

Post-layout simulation using magic and ALIGN are also not exactly the same. ALIGN have lower parasitics effect than Magic. Thus, we observe more delay when performing post-layout simulation using Magic than ALIGN.
